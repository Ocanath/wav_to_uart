This function is designed to handle an incoming serial stream of bytes.

This variant does not use a double buffer, which means that we need explicit state management
in order to determine when to parse the buffer.

That state management is handled with the streaming_state variable.

If streaming is complete, that means that the buffer needs to be parsed. The parser should always set the state flag to COBS_STREAMING_PARSED
